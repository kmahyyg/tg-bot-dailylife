# Current Status

Developing...

# Python - TG BOT - YYG

This bot is used to simplify the app you installed in your phone.
In China mainland, The Android APP eco system is really terrible.

I was concerned about the PackageTracker APP. But it always push the info I don
't want.
I hate to install a lot of "Chinese Malware APP" on my phone. So, now I use Tel
egram as much as possible.
As the most powerful Bot API I have ever seen, I hope that, one day in the futu
re I could only use Telegram to do most of my life.

# Download and Deploy

Still in development. Git Clone and install dependencies. Then run tgbot_fnA.py

More details and improvements will be introduced in the future.

## Dependencies

See more details in requirements.txt

# Personally

Never use Wechat / QQ. Telegram me.

# License

All my open-source project are licensed under AGPL V3, it never has been changed.

# About us

I'm now a freshman in a university. In the past few years, I use ```@chinanet``` TG BOT which brought me a lot of 
happiness. We love checking express packages and make jokes on each other.

However, It stopped working from when I don't know.

I'm trying to practice my programming ability and write this bot to enjoy myself.
